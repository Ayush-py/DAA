Analysis and Complexity:

a)	Worst Case

For Linear Search the worst case occurs when the element is not present in the array, i.e. each element is searched one by one until last element of the array.

Time Complexity: O(n)

b)	Average Case

It is the average of best and worst, i.e. sum of all calculated values divided by sum of all possible inputs.

Time Complexity: n(n+1)/2n = O(n)

c)	Best Case

For Linear Search best case occurs when element is found in the 0th place of array, i.e. one operation is carried out.

Time Complexity: O(1)

Space Complexity: No extra data structure is required. The elements of array are directly compared to the key. Hence, space complexity is O(1).
